            <h1>Human Work Spectrum</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">AI is not eliminating human value—it is revealing it.</p>

            <div class="intro-text">
                <p>Artificial intelligence is collapsing the kind of work that once defined the start of a business
                    career. The long hours spent searching, summarizing, formatting, drafting, and “learning the ropes”
                    through repetition—what this book calls THE GRIND—are rapidly disappearing.</p>
                <p>For students and young professionals, that shift raises an unsettling question: If AI can do so much
                    of what I was trained to do, where does my value come from?</p>

            <h2>About the Book</h2>
            <p>The Human Work Spectrum argues that the shift in work is not a loss, but an evolution. As AI rapidly
                automates the repetitive, predictable, and execution-heavy tasks, human contribution shifts upward into
                higher-order domains of judgment, integration, relationship, and imagination.</p>

            <p>At the core of the book is the Human Work Spectrum, organized around four enduring zones of human
                contribution:</p>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Interpretive • Integrative • Interpersonal • Imaginative</strong></p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Rather than focusing on transient skills or tools, the spectrum maps the
                    cognitive, relational, ethical, and creative terrain where human value concentrates when machines
                    handle routine production.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Building on this foundation, the book introduces ten archetypes of human value—such as the Liaison,
                Translator, Sensemaker, Architect, Orchestrator, Reflective Futurist, Narrative Carrier, and Signal
                Architect—that describe how professionals create meaning, coherence, trust, and direction in AI-rich
                environments.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="audience">
            <h2>Who Is This Book For?</h2>
            <p>This book is written first for late-stage business students and early-career professionals who can feel
                the traditional entry-level grind disappearing and are asking what will make them valuable in an AI-rich
                workplace. If you are preparing to enter the workforce—or are only a few years in—this book offers
                language, models, and direction for designing a professional identity built on judgment, connection, and
                meaning rather than task execution.</p>

            <p>The book is also for educators, advisors, and business-school leaders who are rethinking curriculum,
                assessment, and career preparation in light of artificial intelligence. It provides a shared framework
                for understanding what human value looks like when machines handle routine work—and how institutions can
                prepare graduates not just to adapt, but to thrive.</p>
