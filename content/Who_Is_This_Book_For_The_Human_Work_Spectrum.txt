WHO IS THIS BOOK FOR?

This book is written first for late-stage business students and early-career professionals who can feel the traditional entry-level grind disappearing and are asking what will make them valuable in an AI-rich workplace. If you are preparing to enter the workforce—or are only a few years in—this book offers language, models, and direction for designing a professional identity built on judgment, connection, and meaning rather than task execution.

The book is also for educators, advisors, and business-school leaders who are rethinking curriculum, assessment, and career preparation in light of artificial intelligence. It provides a shared framework for understanding what human value looks like when machines handle routine work—and how institutions can prepare graduates not just to adapt, but to thrive.
